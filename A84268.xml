         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Miles diſtant from the Campe, withall manifeſting that the ſaid Cavaleers had taken their Horſes, under a pretence for his Majeſties Service, and had ſold them to ſeverall Perſons, by whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to the great dammage of the ſaid Owners, humbly deſiring his Majeſty to take it into his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration, and that according to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Declarations and Proteſtations, <hi>that the poreſt of his Prooteſtant Subjects ſhould not want his protection,</hi> he would now, not onely redreſſe thoſe preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:130917:3"/>but protect them from future wrongs and dammages of the like nature.</p>
            <p>Which Petitions were by his Majeſty graciouſly accepted, and thoſe Cavaleers by his Majeſties ſpeciall command put to exemplary punniſhment, to the end that their examples might deterre others from committing the like miſdemeanors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Sanderſon</hi> was cauſed to ride through the Camp, with his fcae towards the Horſe Taile, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſcharged from his Majeſties Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dudley Kilbourne</hi> was put into the <hi>Bilboes</hi> foure houres, and caſheer'd likewiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sammuel Anderton</hi> was in great danger of being hanged, for entring into a poore-mans Houſe, and threatning him, ſaying, he would cut his throate, if he would not tell him where he had hid his old Angels, but being cenſured to ſtand in the <hi>Bilboes</hi> three ſeverall daies, he was committed to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt-Marſhall,</hi> to whome the charge was given, to ſee the ſaid ſentence put in execution.</p>
            <p>Severall Libels and ſcandalous Writings againſt the Parliament, were ſcattered in the Campe, which were ſhewed to his Majeſty, who was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed therewith, openly declaring the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of thoſe ſcandalous Writings, to be the chiefe promoters of theſe troubles and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, withall promiſing reward to him that would produce the Authors, proteſting to make them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to all the ſeditious Spirits in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:130917:3"/>and addicted to melancholy, delighting in no mirth or recreation, onely in ſurveighing his Army, and obſerving the Scituation of the Country, and it is generally hoped (however his Majeſty ſtands ingaged to that Party, for the preſent) that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to alter the Religion of the Kingdome, nor to make Warre againſt his Subjects.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty doth generally declare againſt Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and Oppreſſions, and all his declarations which he frequently publiſheth, are ſeconded with proteſtations, that his Royall intention is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the true Proteſtant Religion, and the antient Laws eſtabliſhed by his Predeceſſours.</p>
            <p>The Cavaleers are very forward in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt <hi>Hull,</hi> and apt to ingage themſelves in any Deſigne, that may in their judgements tend to the promotion of a Warre betweene the King and Parliament, and it is generally beleeved that if his Majeſty had bin as forward as they; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had beene begunne, that would not have beene ended ſuddenly, againſt <hi>Hull</hi> I meane.</p>
            <p>The Gentry and Commonalty of <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> which are now under his Majeſties command, doe declare themſelves for the King and Parliament, tand tis thought as ſoone as the Forces raiſed by ahe Parliament ſhall be on foot, they will call to aſtrict accompt ſome, that now make their power the limit of their wills, and rule both his Majeſty and them by their beguiling pretences.
